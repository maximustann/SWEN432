Boat_Hire_A2_WRONG_a_14.xml:21: element Res_Sailor: Schemas validity error :
Element 'Res_Sailor': Duplicate key-sequence ['sa777'] in unique
identity-constraint 'R_Sailor'.

comment:

There are two [sa777] in <Reserves date = "2014-03-17">. In the question, we
have define that there can not be more than one sailor reserve the boat at the
same date.

The error can not be solved by ID/IDREF.
ID/IDREF could not detect duplicated situation like this. It could only detect
definition of elements or attributes.

comment:
ID/IDREF could detect the error. But it gives a confused feedback of the
error.

Marina: Schemas validity error : Element 'Marina', attribute 'MarinaId': 'pn' is
not a valid value of the atomic type 'xs:ID'.

This problem can be detected by IDREF.

Boat_Hire_A2_WRONG_a_14.xml:24: Schemas validity error : Element 'Res_Sailor':
No match found for key-sequence ['b515'] of keyref 'r_sail'.

comment:
Could not find [b515] in the Sailors' definition.
This problem can not be solved by ID/IDREF.
If define Sailor number="xs:ID", if there is a sailor's number is b515.
However, there is Boat also has a number = b515. Then comflicts appear.
